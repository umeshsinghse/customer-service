Common causes include:&#10;- Container image pull failures or startup crashes&#10;- Insufficient CPU/memory resources&#10;- Failed health check endpoints&#10;- Network connectivity issues&#10;- Configuration errors in deployment manifest&#10;&#10;**Troubleshooting Steps Performed:**&#10;1. Applied deployment configuration successfully&#10;2. Monitored rollout progress showing inconsistent replica updates&#10;3. Deployment timed out after multiple retry attempts&#10;4. Process terminated with exit code 1&#10;&#10;**Next Actions Required:**&#10;- Check pod logs and events for specific error details&#10;- Verify resource quotas and node capacity&#10;- Validate container image availability and health check endpoints&#10;- Review deployment manifest for configuration issues" />
